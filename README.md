# INTRODUCTION

Fog reduces visibility, limits contrast, distorts perception and causes many car accidents each year.

Fog is produced by the suspension of very fine moisture droplets in the air.  When light hits these droplets, it scatters and results in a loss of contrast and a dense white background.  

As these droplets get smaller, fog gets thicker and makes for roadways that are even more blanketed.  As a result, car drivers cannot see very far ahead, and car accidents become an even greater possibility than normal.


# Approach for end product

With the help of piezoelectric sensors and various other sensors. Trying to come up with an efficient method which can not only reduce road accidents due to fog but can also provide electricity on Road/streets.
